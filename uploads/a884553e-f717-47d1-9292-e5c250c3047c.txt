Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease caused by Plasmodium parasites. It can be serious if not treated early, so knowing the symptoms and prevention (precaution) steps is very important.

Common Symptoms of Malaria

Symptoms usually appear 10â€“15 days after an infected mosquito bite (but may vary depending on the parasite type).

Early symptoms (often mild, like flu):

Fever and chills (often in cycles)

Headache

Muscle and joint pain

Fatigue and weakness

Sweating

Nausea and vomiting

Progressed or severe symptoms (if untreated):

High, recurring fevers

Severe anemia (paleness, weakness)

Jaundice (yellowing of skin/eyes)

Seizures

Breathing difficulty

Confusion or coma (cerebral malaria)

Severe malaria can be life-threatening, especially in children, pregnant women, and people with weak immunity.

Precautions (Prevention)

Since malaria is transmitted by the Anopheles mosquito, prevention focuses on avoiding bites and reducing mosquito breeding:

Avoid Mosquito Bites

Use insect repellent (with DEET, picaridin, or lemon-eucalyptus oil).

Wear long-sleeved clothing and pants, especially at night.

Sleep under insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs).

Stay in places with window screens or air conditioning.

Environmental Measures

Eliminate stagnant water around homes (mosquito breeding sites).

Use mosquito sprays or larvicides in water storage areas.

Medication (Chemoprophylaxis)

In malaria-endemic areas or when traveling, doctors may prescribe preventive medicines (e.g., chloroquine, doxycycline, mefloquine, or atovaquone-proguanil depending on region and resistance patterns).

Awareness & Early Treatment

If you develop fever within weeks of being in a malaria-prone area, get tested immediately.

Early diagnosis with a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) or blood smear and prompt treatment with antimalarial drugs is crucial.
